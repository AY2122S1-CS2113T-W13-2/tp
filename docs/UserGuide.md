It's me, **Gordon Ramsay v1.0**, and today, I'm gonna teach you ****** how to use the Gordon CLI application.

I am a CLI-based recipe database application, and I can help you to;
1) Store your recipes
2) Check them when you're ready to cook
3) Organise your collection of recipes
4) Delete recipes like the chicken you cooked so raw I can still hear it clucking

It's absolutely bonkers. Now let's get down to business.
