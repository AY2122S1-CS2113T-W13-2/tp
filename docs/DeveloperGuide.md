## Design

### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./RenderedUML/ArchitectureDiagram.svg)

The Diagram above explains how the App is designed and will function

Given below we have a quick overview of all the main components of Gordon as well as how these pieces interact with each other

*Main Components*

`Main` contains both `main` and `run`. It is responsible for:

1. Once the App is launched, `main` will call `run` to initialize the necessary components for the App to function properly
2. On exit, the App will print the corresponding messages and execute the necessary cleanup methods.

The App is organized by the `command`, `exception`, `kitchen`, and `util` packages that represent a collection of various different components that are deal with different parts of the functions of the App

1. `command`: Contains all the `XYZ_Command` components that deal with the inputs that the user is able to make.
2. `exception`: Contains all the the `GordonException` component that is used throughout the App
3. `kitchen`: Contains the `Cookbook` and `Recipe` components that deal with the management of the cookbook
4. `util`: Contains the `Difficulty`, `Parser`, `Tag` and `UI` components that deal with the functionality of the App

*How do these components interact with each other*

The Sequence Diagram below will show how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add`.

![Sequence Diagram](./RenderedUML/AddSequence.svg)

### Cookbook component

The Diagram below is the class diagram for the ``Kitchen`` package

![Cookbook Class Diagram](./RenderedUML/Kitchen.svg)

The `Cookbook` Class is instantiated by the `Gordon` Class, and manages the recipes and tags of the cookbook.

The `Cookbook` class consists of 2 main attributes
1. The array `recipes` that stores all the main recipes currently in Gordon.
2. The array `cookbookTags` that stores all the tags currently in Gordon.

The `Cookbook` class can be classified into 3 main functionalities:

1. Recipe Management : 
  - Add recipes using the `addRecipe` method
  - Remove recipes using the `removeRecipe` method
  - Check whether a recipe exist using the `checkRecipe` method
  - Add calories to a recipe using the `setCalories` method
  - Add price to a recipe using the `setPrice` method
  - Add preparation time to a recipe using the `setTimes` method

2. Tag Management :
  - Add a new tag to the `cookbookTags` array using the `addCookbookTag` method
  - Delete a tag from the `cookbookTags` array using the `deleteCookbookTag` method
  - Add a recipe to the list of recipes associated with a particular tag using the `appendRecipeToCookbookTag` method
  - Remove a recipe from the list of recipes associated with a particular tag using the `deleteRecipeToCookBookTag` method
  - Add a tag to a recipe using the `addTagToRecipes` method
  - Delete a tag from a recipe using the `deleteTagFromRecipes` method
  - List all tags in the `cookbookTags` array using the `listCookBookTags` method
  - Check whether a particular tag exists using the `doesCookBookTagExist` method

3. Filter Recipes : 
  - Filter recipes in the `recipes` array by ingredients using the `filterByIngredients` method
  - Filter recipes in the `recipes` array by tags using the `filterByTags` method
  - Filter recipes in the `recipes` array by difficulty using the `filterByDifficulty` method
  - Filter recipes in the `recipes` array by price using the `filterByPrice` method
  - Filter recipes in the `recipes` array by calories using the `filterByCalories` method
  - Filter recipes in the `recipes` array by time using the `filterByTime` method

### Recipe component

### Parser component

The diagram below is the class diagram for the `Parser` class

![Command Class Diagram](./RenderedUML/Parser.svg)

Functions of the Parser class:
* Reads in user input by implementing the `Scanner` class
  * The parseMaster() method parses through the user's input to find the best match for the user's intended command
  * The corresponding command is then returned to the `Gordon` class
* Prints responses to the console by implementing the `UI` class

### Command component

The Diagram below is the class diagram for the Command Class

![Command Class Diagram](./RenderedUML/CommandRects.svg)

The `Command` class contains all the basic functionality of the Gordon cookbook, and is the Class that executes specific commands given by the user.

The `Command` class can be classified into 4 main functionalities:

1. Basic Commands: 
   * The Commands that are required for the basic feature set of the Gordon cookbook are contained here
   * `AddCommand` is where the `addRecipe` feature is executed
   * `CheckCommand` is where the `checkRecipe` feature is executed
   * `DeleteRecipeCommand` is where the `deleteRecipe` feature is executed
   * `ListRecipesCommand` is where the `listRecipes` feature is executed
   * `HelpCommand` is where the `help` feature is executed
2. Find Commands:
   * The Commands that are required for the `find` feature of Gordon are contained here
   * `FindCaloriesCommand` is where the `find` /calories feature of gordon is executed 
   * `FindDifficultyCommand` is where the `find` /difficulty feature of gordon is executed
   * `FindIngredientsCommand` is where the `find` /ingredients feature of gordon is executed
   * `FindPriceCommand` is where the `find` /price feature of gordon is executed
3. Set Commands:
   * The Commands that are required for the `set` feature of Gordon are contained here
   * `SetCaloriesCommand` is where the `set` /calories feature of gordon is executed
   * `SetDifficultyCommand` is where the `set` /difficulty feature of gordon is executed
   * `SetPriceCommand` is where the `set` /price feature of gordon is executed
4. Tag Commands:
   * The Commands that are required for the  `tag` feature of Gordon are contained here
   * `TagAddCommand` is where the `tag` feature of gordon is executed
   * `TagDeleteCommand` is where the `deleteTag` feature of gordon is executed
   * `TagUntagCommand` is where the `untag` feature of gordon is executed

### Storage component

### UI Component

### Tag Component
The `Tag` class contains the basic functionalities related to a _Tag_, and encapsulates the behavior of a _Tag_.
1. `getTagName` returns the _Tag Name_.
2. `containsAssociatedRecipeNames` checks for the existence of a particular _Recipe Name_ within a _Tag_.
3. `addAssociatedRecipeName` adds a _Recipe Name_ to the `ArrayList<String>` containing all such names. 
4. 'removeAssociatedRecipeName' removes a _Recipe Name_ from the `ArrayList<String` containing all such names.

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### XYZ

## Product scope
